## Goal
A Tensorlfow deep learning project to recognize different species of flowers.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [Tensorflow 2.9](https://tensorflow.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

### Code

Code is provided in the `Project_Image_Classifier_Project.ipynb` notebook file.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `finding_identify_customer_segmentsdonors/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook Project_Image_Classifier_Project.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook Project_Image_Classifier_Project.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data

The dataset consists of the following images downloaded using tensorflow_datasets module:
  - https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/oxford_flowers102

**Features**
- Features are defined as the colors of the pixels in the imae(s).
